## Question Bank Outline
### Beginner Samples
- Explain difference between an overnight index swap and a term interest rate swap.
- Walk through how you would calculate the present value of a fixed vs floating leg using discount factors.
- Define FTP and why treasury adjusts business unit funding charges.
- What drives the Liquidity Coverage Ratio? How can treasury influence it?
- Given a simple balance sheet snapshot, identify major interest rate risks.
- Outline the key committees involved in treasury decision making and their purposes.

### Intermediate Samples
- You manage a USD liquidity gap 6 months out. Outline derivative tools to cover it and discuss pros/cons.

- Stress scenario: deposit flight + curve steepening. How do LCR and NSFR react?
- Compare using cross-currency swap vs issuing foreign currency debt for funding.

### Senior Samples
- Design a hedge strategy for a global bank experiencing coordinated rate cuts across regions.
- Debate the merits of using callable structures vs vanilla swaps for balance sheet optionality.

## Follow-up & Probing Questions
- Quantitative drill-downs: “Show the impact on DV01 if we extend tenor by 2y.”
- Governance depth: “Which committees must sign off on this strategy and why?”
- Scenario evolution: “If CCAR stress worsens funding costs by 50 bps, how do you adapt?”
- Client orientation: “How would you pitch this structure to a corporate treasurer?”
- Technology: “Which systems/controls track collateral and liquidity in real time?”

## Practice Utilities
